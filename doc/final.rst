Final
=====

8am on Tuesday, May 22nd.  Same room as usual, GOL-2435.

Requirements
------------

**Team Evaluations (20% of your final grade)**

 - 200-1000 words per teammate.  Indicate what they did to contribute to the
   project.  What skills did they pick up this quarter?  What skills should they
   develop further?  Give a numeric score (1-10) for them and justify it.
 - These must be emailed to the professor at rjbpop@rit.edu **before** 8am,
   Tuesday morning to receive full credit.  They will remain private.

**Final Presentation (20% of your final grade)**

The following are rough guidelines, not a hard-and-fast checklist for your
presentations.

 - Your presentations should last 20 minutes with another 10 minutes for
   discussion.
 - Your team will need to present from the front of the classroom with some sort
   of presentation software (powerpoint, libreoffice, impress.js, prezi,... your
   choice).
 - Every member of your team needs to speak for a roughly equal amount of the
   presentation.  Be prepared.
 - Do a demonstration of your project.
 - How does the code work?

   - What are some of the best pieces of software you wrote?  Why?
   - What are some of the worst pieces?  Why?

 - Make sure that you comment on progress over the quarter.  What stumbling
   blocks were there and what successes?
 - What would you have done differently?
 - What would you have worked on if you'd had more time?

**Finished Project (20% of your final grade)**

 - Add a fully-fleshed out entry and link to your project information to this
   wiki page: http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Math4Team/RIT/Projects

   - Use the examples already there as a standard for the quality of your
     addition.

 - Your grade here will be derived from the following factors (adjusted for
   progress over the quarter):

   - Is the code clearly licensed under an OSI-compatible license?
   - Does your source repository contains Written instructions for future
     developers.  How can they setup their environment to work on your project?
     What TODO items are left to do?
   - Does it work on python on a normal machine?
   - Does it work on the OLPC?
   - Code quality and git commit history.
   - Quality of the wiki entry at sugarlabs.org
