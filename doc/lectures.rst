   ``qalthos`` in IRC or qalthos ~@~ gmail.com
 - OLPC Distribution

   - I need your DCE name.
   - These must be returned at the end of the quarter under penalty of death.

 - OLPC Smoke Test

   - http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Smoke_test/10.1.x/1_hour_smoke_test
   - The one exception to the smoke test is that you need to
     use ``connect-rit`` in the terminal activity to connect
     to ``ritwpa2``.  Just open the terminal activity and run
     ``./connect-rit``.  Each XO should have it.
   - **Oh no!** the ``connect-rit`` script is busted!

     - If this is the case for you, you can get a new copy of it from
       https://github.com/Qalthos/connect-rit -- Use a USB key to transfer it
       to the OLPC.
